# **Handwritten Digits Classification**
--------------------------------------

## **Dataset Description**

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology" and is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It have Training set of 60,000 images and Testing set of 10,000 images.

We have performed Convolution Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the hanwritten digits.

--------
## **Challenges faced**:

No such challenges we have to faced because it is MNIST dataset, So No EDA we need to perform.
